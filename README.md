# PianoPianoRevolution

HackHolyoke 2016

PianoPianoRevolution is a new technology that utilizes an off-the-shelf affordable sensor like the Leap Motion with a lasercut keyboard to create a piano using 3D motion tracking, 2D mapping, and complex algorithms. The piano is fully playable up to two octaves around the middle C key, and users can play scales, chords, and even whole piano pieces. The idea behind this project was to investigate whether it was possible to create a really modular, cheap alternative to complex, expensive equipment such as a grand piano. We believe we have created a proof of concept showing that it is indeed possible to use high-end technology to make such affordable instruments. Especially with the introduction of precise depth sensors in new smart phones, all one really needs is a transparent platform with keyboard etchings, a nice infrared depth sensor, and PianoPianoRevolution can provide you with music to your ears.
